nodejs-atm-app
==============

This app is super easy to get up and running! 

1) Just clone the repo to your local box
2) Type `npm install`, to install the app's dependencies
3) Type `npm start`, to start the server
4) Visit http://localhost:3000 to view the app

It's very barebones but it gets the job done :)
